## Lessons

### 1. Introduction

- [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) were introduced in [React v16.8](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html)
- They let use of state and other React features without using `class`es
- They allow reuse of stateful logic without changing component hierarchy
- They donâ€™t work inside `class`es and their names always start with `use`
- They are special functions that lets "hook into" React features (e.g. `useState` for state)
