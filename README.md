## Lessons

### 1. Introduction

- [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) were introduced in [React v16.8](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html)
- They let use of state and other React features without using `class`es
- They allow reuse of stateful logic without changing component hierarchy
- They donâ€™t work inside `class`es and their names always start with `use`
- They are special functions that lets "hook into" React features (e.g. `useState` for state)

### 2. Rules of Hooks

React Hooks require **two** important rules to be followed.

#### 2.1. Do's

Call Hooks &hellip;

1. at the top level to ensure the same order to correctly preserve state of Hooks
2. from React functions (e.g. function components and custom Hooks)

#### 2.2. Dont's

Don't call Hooks &hellip;

1. inside loops, conditions or nested functions
2. from regular JavaScript functions

> **NOTES:**
>
> - These two important rules can be checked with [eslint-plugin-react-hooks](https://npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks)
> - `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` is included in [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/eslint-config-react-app/package.json#L29)'s [eslint-config-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/eslint-config-react-app/package.json#L29)
